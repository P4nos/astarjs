# Visualize Astar

## Description

This is an implementation of the Astar path finding algorithm using pure Javascript, HTML and CSS. The algrorithm implementation was mostly based on
resources found [here](https://theory.stanford.edu/~amitp/GameProgramming/AStarComparison.html).

The goal of this project was twofold, first to understand the Astar algorithm and second to reinforce the learning process by visualising the actions the algorithm takes.
